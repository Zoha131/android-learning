## Note

* Using a RecyclerView has the following key steps:

    1. Add RecyclerView support library to the gradle build file
    2. Define a model class to use as the data source
    3. Add a RecyclerView to your activity to display the items
    4. Create a custom row layout XML file to visualize the item
    5. Create a RecyclerView.Adapter and ViewHolder to render the item
    6. Bind the adapter to the data source to populate the RecyclerView
